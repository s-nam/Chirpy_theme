## Hi, I am Saekwang Nam.

*At Mont Saint-Michel, Sep. 18th, 2019*

### What I am doing
I am currently a Ph.D. student in the [Haptic Intelligence department](https://hi.is.mpg.de){:target="_blank"} of Max Planck Institue for Intelligent Systems. I am working on understanding the roles of moisture on the finger pad for stable object grasping. The project starts by looking at physical changes on the finger during the finger-object contact. The observational and analytical research results are going to be published in some journal and conference papers. If I have further time, I am going to work on machine learning-based object grasping strategies.

### Tracing my life so far...
I was born in **South Korea**. After high school, I could get a chance to **study in Japan** with the government funding called the "Korea-Japan Government Scholarship Program." Thus, I studied at Kanazawa University, majoring in mechanical engineering. While studying there, I decided to become a robot scientist who can understand both **mechanical engineering** and **computer science** fields. The passion led me to study computer science at the **University of California, San Diego**. Once the master course was over, I had to go back to South Korea to finish the mandatory military service. Luckily, the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), one of the government-funded research institutes in Korea, hired me as technical research personnel (considered as a military servant). In **ETRI**, I developed several applications based on electroactive polymers and the related programs. I then came across to Germany for my doctoral studies.

### The purpose of this website
In addition to the studies in my own field, I also have learned how to improve my **English writings**. At the same time, I learned a lot about **probabilistic machine learning**. This website is built mainly to summarize such knowledge.
