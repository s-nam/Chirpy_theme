## Hi, I am Saekwang Nam.

*At Mont Saint-Michel, Sep. 18th, 2019*

### What I am doing
I am currently a postdoctoral research associate in the [Dexterous Robotics Group](https://www.bristolroboticslab.com/dexterous-robotics){:target="_blank"} of Bristol Robotics Laboratory (University of Bristol), United Kingdom. I am working on friction-based control of a robot gripper for the robot's dexterous object manipulation.

### Tracing my life so far...
I was born in **South Korea**. After high school, I could have a chance to **study in Japan** with government funding called the "Korea-Japan Government Scholarship Program." Thus, I studied at Kanazawa University, majoring in mechanical engineering. While studying there, I decided to become a robot scientist who can understand both **mechanical engineering** and **computer science** fields. This passion led me to study computer science at the **University of California, San Diego**. Once the master's course was over, I had to go back to South Korea to finish the mandatory military service. Alternatively, the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI), one of the government-funded research institutes in Korea, hired me as technical research personnel (considered as a military servant). In **ETRI**, I developed several applications based on electroactive polymers and programs to actuate the polymers.

From Sep. 2017 to Oct. 2022, I studied as a Ph.D. student in the [Haptic Intelligence Department](https://hi.is.mpg.de){:target="_blank"} of **Max Planck Institue for Intelligent Systems**. I was working on understanding the roles of moisture on the finger pad for stable object grasping. The project starts by looking at physical changes on the finger during the finger-object contact. On Oct. 12th, 2022, I successfully defended my doctoral dissertation and graduated from the Computer Science Department of the University of Tuebingen through [IMPRS-IS](https://imprs.is.mpg.de/){:target="_blank"} doctoral program.

### The purpose of this website
This website provides helpful insights on writing **scientific papers in English** (written in Korean, sorry for international readers). In addition, I would like to update some repositories or pages about **the installation and control of a robot arm** and the related knowledge.

If you are interested more in me, please check my [Curriculum Vitae](https://s-nam.github.io/assets/files/cv_Saekwang_Nam.pdf){:target="_blank"} or email me. (You can find my email address in my CV.)
